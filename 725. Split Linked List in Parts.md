## Description
Given the head of a singly linked list and an integer k, split the linked list into k consecutive linked list parts.
The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than one. This may lead to some parts being null.
The parts should be in the order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier should always have a size greater than or equal to parts occurring later.   

Return an array of the k parts.

## Algorithm
Let n be the length of the given linked list.
Let (integer)remainder be the remainder of n / k.
Let (integer)quotient be the quotient of n / k.
We have two conditions:
1. If k is larger and equal than n.
2. If k is smaller than n.

Time complexity: O(n).  
Space complexity: O(1).

## Solution
~~~
class Solution {
    public ListNode[] splitListToParts(ListNode head, int k) {
        // calculate the length of the list
        ListNode tmp = head;
        int n = 0;
        while (tmp != null) {
            tmp = tmp.next;
            n++;
        }

        int quotient = n / k;
        int remainder = n % k;
        ListNode[] result = new ListNode[k];
        if (head == null) {
            return result;
        }

        ListNode curr = head;
        ListNode prev = null;
        int p = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            result[i] = curr;
            int length = 0;
            if (p < remainder) {
                length = quotient + 1;
            } else {
                length = quotient;
            }
            for (int j = 0; j < length; j++) {
                    prev = curr;
                    curr = curr.next;
            }
            p++;
            prev.next = null;
        }
        return result;
    }
}

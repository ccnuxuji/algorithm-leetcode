## Description
There is a binary tree rooted at 0 consisting of n nodes. The nodes are labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 0-indexed integer array parents representing the tree, where parents[i] is the parent of node i. Since node 0 is the root, parents[0] == -1.

Each node has a score. To find the score of a node, consider if the node and the edges connected to it were removed. The tree would become one or more non-empty subtrees. The size of a subtree is the number of the nodes in it. The score of the node is the product of the sizes of all those subtrees.

Return the number of nodes that have the highest score.

## Algorithm
1. Generate a map to store the children nodes for each node. 
2. Calculate the node score for every node, there are there conditions:
    - If the current node is root node, we directly count the number of each child node and then multiply them.
    - If the current node is a leaf node, the score is nodeNum - 1.
    - If the current node is a mid node, the score is leftSubtreeNum * rightSubtreeNum * (nodeNum - leftSubtreeNum - rightSubtreeNum)
3. Save the score of each node to an array, and record the  largest score value.
4. Iterate the score array, count the num of nodes with highest score.

Time complexity: O(n&sup2;).  
Space complexity: O(n&sup2;).

class Solution {
    long maxScore = 0;
    int cnt = 0;
    int n;
    List<Integer>[] children;

    public int countHighestScoreNodes(int[] parents) {
        n = parents.length;
        children = new List[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            children[i] = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int p = parents[i];
            if (p != -1) {
                children[p].add(i);
            }
        }
        dfs(0);
        return cnt;
    }

    public int dfs(int node) {
        long score = 1;
        int size = n - 1;
        for (int c : children[node]) {
            int t = dfs(c);
            score *= t;
            size -= t;
        }
        if (node != 0) {
            score *= size;
        }
        if (score == maxScore) {
            cnt++;
        } else if (score > maxScore) {
            maxScore = score;
            cnt = 1;
        }
        return n - size;
    }
}

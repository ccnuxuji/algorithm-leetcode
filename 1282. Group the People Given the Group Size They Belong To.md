## Description
There are n people that are split into some unknown number of groups. Each person is labeled with a unique ID from 0 to n - 1.

You are given an integer array groupSizes, where groupSizes[i] is the size of the group that person i is in. For example, if groupSizes[1] = 3, then person 1 must be in a group of size 3.

Return a list of groups such that each person i is in a group of size groupSizes[i].

Each person should appear in exactly one group, and every person must be in a group. If there are multiple answers, return any of them. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one valid solution for the given input.

## Algorithm
1. Create a map that the key is the group size and the value is a list of persons need to be in this size of group.
2. Loop through this map, and assign the persons into proper groups.

Time Complexity: O(n);
Space Complexity: O(n);

## Solution
~~~
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> groupThePeople(int[] groupSizes) {
        int n = groupSizes.length;
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int size = groupSizes[i];
            List<Integer> persons = map.getOrDefault(size, new LinkedList<Integer>());
            persons.add(i);
            map.put(size, persons);
        }

        List<List<Integer>> result = new LinkedList<>();
        int m = map.size();
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, List<Integer>> entry : map) {
            int size = entry.getKey();
            List persons = entry.getValue();
            int numGroups = persons.size() / size;
            for (int j = 0; j < numGroups; j++) {
                List<Integer> tmp = new LinkedList<>();
                for (int k = 0; k < size; k++) {
                    tmp.add(persons.removeFirst());
                }
                result.add(tmp);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
